The performance difference between placing try-catch statements inside or outside a loop in ABAP is negligible, as the bytecode efficiently handles exceptions with minimal overhead. The impact is measured in microseconds, indicating that try-catch placement has little effect on runtime.

---
To address the question and gain some insights, let’s approach the problem from two perspectives. First, devise and establish appropriate test cases, run and measure them, and then analyse what happens at a deeper level in the ABAP bytecode.

**Define the Test Cases**

Let's define four test cases to evaluate the performance impact of try-catch statements in different scenarios:

1. **\<TRY [LOOP]\>**  
try/catch outside the loop
2. **[LOOP \<TRY\>]**  
try/catch inside  the loop
3. **\<TRY [LOOP EXCP]\>**  
try/catch outside the loop with an exception thrown
4. **[LOOP \<TRY EXCP\>]**  
try/catch inside  the loop with an exception thrown 


Below, I will show the relevant parts of the code to illustrate the testing process.<br/>
For looping, the `DO` keyword is used (in bytecode, it is translated into the WHILx opcode, like other looping statements).<br/>
To measure the runtime the construct  `+REP x TIMES. ...code... +ENDREP RESULTS structure.`  is used. It repeats the code inside it `x` times and records time measurements in the `structure` of type `REP_S_RESULTS`, from which the component `RTIME` - gross time - is used for the calculations. The REP statement is directly translated into the bytecode REP opcode.

ABAP coding for [[LOOP \<TRY\>]](src/test_trycatch_loop/zcl_t_trycatch_inside_loop.clas.abap) and [[LOOP \<TRY EXCP\>]](src/test_trycatch_loop/zcl_t_trycatch_inside_loop_ex.clas.abap):
```
  METHOD zif_measurement_test~run_test.

    DATA: l_d TYPE decfloat34, l_f TYPE f.

    +REP iv_measurement_repeats TIMES.
    DO iv_measurement_iterations TIMES.
      TRY.
          l_d = zcl_measurement_blackhole=>consume( ).

          mv_total_calculations = mv_total_calculations + 1.

          IF sy-index = iv_measurement_iterations.

            l_f = 1 / 1.   " test case with thrown exception has l_f = 1 / 0. in this line

          ELSE.
            l_f = 1 / 2.
          ENDIF.

        CATCH cx_root.
          mv_total_exceptions = mv_total_exceptions + 1.
      ENDTRY.
    ENDDO.
    +ENDREP RESULTS rs_results.

  ENDMETHOD.
```

ABAP coding for [\<TRY [LOOP]\>](src/test_trycatch_loop/zcl_t_trycatch_outside_loop.clas.abap) and [\<TRY [LOOP EXCP]\>](src/test_trycatch_loop/zcl_t_trycatch_outside_loop_ex.clas.abap):
```
  METHOD zif_measurement_test~run_test.

    DATA: l_d TYPE decfloat34, l_f TYPE f.

    +REP iv_measurement_repeats TIMES.
    TRY.
        DO iv_measurement_iterations TIMES.

          l_d = zcl_measurement_blackhole=>consume( ).

          mv_total_calculations = mv_total_calculations + 1.

          IF sy-index = iv_measurement_iterations.

            l_f = 1 / 1.   " test case with thrown exception has l_f = 1 / 0. in this line

          ELSE.
            l_f = 1 / 2.
          ENDIF.

        ENDDO.
      CATCH cx_root.
        mv_total_exceptions = mv_total_exceptions + 1.
    ENDTRY.
    +ENDREP RESULTS rs_results.

  ENDMETHOD.
```

The [`zcl_measurement_blackhole=>consume( )`](src/infra/zcl_measurement_blackhole.clas.abap) method does not do anything special; just introduces some calculations to create a CPU load and obtain more scaled time values:
```
  METHOD consume.
    rv_double = compute_single( cv_pi ). + compute_single( cv_pi * 2 ).
  ENDMETHOD.

  METHOD compute_single.
    DATA: lv_index TYPE i VALUE 0.

    rv_double = iv_double.

    WHILE lv_index < 10.
      rv_double = rv_double * rv_double / cv_pi.
      lv_index = lv_index + 1.
    ENDWHILE.
  ENDMETHOD.
```

The code was kept minimalistic and consistent across all test cases to execute the statements of interest and produce relevant time measures.

**Execution of Test Cases**

The [four test cases](src/test_trycatch_loop/zcl_run_trycatch_loop.clas.abap) [were executed](src/execute/z_trycatch_loop_measure.prog.abap) with 101, 501, 1001, and 5001 single runs, respectively. One _single run_ (the code inside +REP ... +ENDREP) is `10` loop iterations repeated 
`n` times where `n = 100 + single_runs_couter` (i.e. increasing by `1` per single run). In the relevant test cases, one exception was thrown per 10 loop iterations.

```
...
    DO mv_measurement_total_tests TIMES.
      ls_test_stat = lo_t_trycatch_inside_loop->run_test( iv_measurement_repeats = mv_measurement_repeats iv_measurement_iterations = mv_measurement_iterations ).
      INSERT VALUE #( rtime = ls_test_stat-rtime / mv_measurement_repeats test_id = lo_t_trycatch_inside_loop->test_id )  INTO TABLE mt_results.

      ls_test_stat = lo_t_trycatch_outside_loop->run_test( iv_measurement_repeats = mv_measurement_repeats iv_measurement_iterations = mv_measurement_iterations ).
      INSERT VALUE #( rtime = ls_test_stat-rtime / mv_measurement_repeats test_id = lo_t_trycatch_outside_loop->test_id ) INTO TABLE mt_results.

      ls_test_stat = lo_t_trycatch_inside_loop_ex->run_test( iv_measurement_repeats = mv_measurement_repeats iv_measurement_iterations = mv_measurement_iterations ).
      INSERT VALUE #( rtime = ls_test_stat-rtime / mv_measurement_repeats test_id = lo_t_trycatch_inside_loop_ex->test_id ) INTO TABLE mt_results.

      ls_test_stat = lo_t_trycatch_outside_loop_ex->run_test( iv_measurement_repeats = mv_measurement_repeats iv_measurement_iterations = mv_measurement_iterations ).
      INSERT VALUE #( rtime = ls_test_stat-rtime / mv_measurement_repeats test_id = lo_t_trycatch_outside_loop_ex->test_id ) INTO TABLE mt_results.

      mv_measurement_repeats = mv_measurement_repeats + 1.
    ENDDO.
...
```

The gross runtime from all tests was recorded in the `mt_results` table and is summarised in the table below. Here, the median, average, and standard deviation are calculated for 10 loop iterations in microseconds for each test case. Additionally, the totals of single runs and loop executions per test are shown:


|Value, ms|Runs|Loops|\<TRY [LOOP]\>|[LOOP \<TRY\>]|\<TRY [LOOP EXCP]\>|[LOOP \<TRY EXCP\>]|
|----|----:|----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|Median<br/>10 loops|101<br/>501<br/>1001<br/>5001|151.5K<br/>1.75M<br/> 6.01M <br/>130.03M|55.31<br/>55.19<br/>55.50<br/>56.50|55.53<br/>55.49<br/>55.97<br/>56.75|57.65<br/>57.91<br/>57.91<br/>59.04|57.78<br/>57.95<br/>58.05<br/>59.25|

|σ<br/>10 loops|101<br/>501<br/>1001<br/>5001|151.5K<br/>1.75M<br/> 6.01M <br/>130.03M|0.68<br/>3.92<br/>6.29<br/>3.86|0.44<br/>4.95<br/>3.44<br/>3.75|0.30<br/>5.73<br/>3.53<br/>4.42|0.91<br/>5.15<br/>5.06<br/>4.40|

As we can see, there is no significant performance difference based on the position of the try-catch statements. The total time difference across all tests is only on the order of microseconds.


**Bytecode details**

To look deeper, let’s delve into the bytecode level. The source code is first compiled into bytecode. It is the intermediate low-level representation of the program consisting of a set of instructions (opcodes) interpreted by the SAP kernel. These are further translated into the binary representation for the target platform to execute ABAP programs.
 

Several opcodes are relevant for understanding what happens in our test cases:

* **BRAX / BRAN**: Branch always relative / Branch always. These are used to jump unconditionally to a specific location in the bytecode sequence.

* **EXCP**: Exception Call. This is used to manage exception handling or to raise exceptions within the program.

While I won’t delve into all opcodes and their arguments due to the closed nature of bytecode specifications, we can deduce enough to explain the measurements above.

Below is the bytecode compiled for the test cases, with extraneous lines / details removed for clarity and comments added:

In the “Inside Loop” scenario, the EXCP opcode is executed in each loop iteration to set up exception handling. However, because the program is already loaded and allocated in memory, the target addresses of handlers are pre-determined and do not need recalculation each time. Due to optimisations, the exception handlers resolution table might be created once for the program and referenced afterward.

When no exception is thrown, the catch blocks are bypassed. However, if an exception is thrown, the appropriate handler is resolved and invoked, resulting in some overhead.
